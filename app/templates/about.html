      My name is Austin Heinrich. I'm a developer from the Canadian prairies interested in web development, building
      video games, machine learning and AI, and basically whatever else crosses my path.  
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently working on some stuff! I am writing a mod for Paradox Studio's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellaris_(video_game)">Stellaris</a>
      and I am making a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_game">God game</a> utilizing LLM-powered agents. I'll
      talk about them more here when I have a Projects section. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Otherwise, I work for Andgo Systems out of Saskatoon, Canada. We make absence management software.

  <h2>About this Website</h2>
  <div class="about-website">
    <p>
      The name of this website is an old (and current) screen name I've used since the days of playing Runescape in my 
      elementary school's computer lab at lunch. I liked the letter X, as it is a cool letter, but that was too short 
      for a user name -- so I did the sensible thing and added a weird suffix to it. Voila, <code>xarillian</code> was
      born. I've since stopped playing Runescape; the core gameplay never really resonated with me, but it continues to haunt
      me in mentions from friends and colleagues.

      This site is built with Flask and HTMX, embracing minimalism in both design and technology while still being just
      a touch dramatic (fun fact, it even has continuous deployment through AWS). Flask provides a lightweight Python 
      framework that gets out of the way, while HTMX allows for dynamic content without the overhead of a full 
      JavaScript framework. The source code can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/xarillian/xarillian.com/">GitHub</a>.
