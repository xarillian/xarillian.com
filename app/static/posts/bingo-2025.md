The past few years, I've written all of my goals down on a whiteboard in a large checklist. Sometimes I get through them all; a lot of the time I get through maybe half. In 2024, I was very ambitious. Too ambitious. I wanted to compose a song without knowing how to play the piano, dive into the hardest parts of embedded software without doing anything introductory, and hit a large savings goal. Some good came of that -- I relearned the piano, and if it weren't for a series of emergencies over the year, I would have hit the savings goal. But with embedded software, I hit a rut because what I wanted to do was so far out there that I couldn't see the starting point (that's bad!).

One of the only goals I hit was a modest 50K word target, which rekindled my love of writing and honestly that probably got me into the very good headspace I'm currently in. Because I fell so short last year, and because I saw someone else do it on the TikTok, I was inspired to create a "bingo" card for this year's personal development. That way, if I don't achieve everything, that's okay. I just have to hit a bingo -- a straight line across the board. That should be easy, right?

In the spirit of bingo, I didn't just want goals there either. I had to have some random events and states of being, just to give it some randomness in case I decided to go whole hog and try to get everything done. I could say more, but putting it out there seems better.

## The Goals

**Get a random compliment from a stranger:** I don't control this one, but I hope it happens!

**Find something amazing at a thrift shop:** This one I tangentially control, but it mostly relates to wanting to thrift more.

**12 books read:** 1 book/month is always a good goal

**3 camping trips:** I did two last year. One more this year!

**Save $5K:** Deliberately modest compared to last year to not incur violent wrath upon my savings like last year.

**Stretch for 30 days:** I'm unbearably stiff. That's not "consecutive days" btw, that's any thirty days.

**Someone recommends a song I end up loving:** Another one I don't control

**Try an adrenaline activity:** My wife says "getting into a car crash doesn't count"

**Do a winter hike:** I never have!

**States hiking trip:** I did a trip to Montana last year. We're hoping to make this a tradition.

**Triathlon:** A sprint triathlon.

**Go to a night sky preserve:** There's one a province over. I love seeing the night sky.

**FREE:** Learn anything to claim this space.

**Dig a really deep hole?** One day I will have this manic energy and will dig this hole.

**Consistently achieve the second jhana:** I can only hit the first reliably. I don't even know if I've hit the second before.

**Host a dinner party for friends:** Seems fun!

**Swim Meet:** Goes with the triathlon. I've been swimming competitively in a masters program and I should be ready this year.

**Run into an old friend unexpectedly and form a genuine connection:** Love this one

**Play Megalovania on piano:** Continuing my piano goal

**6 blood donations:** Goodbye microplastics

**Abs + Geta sandals summer:** I have a specific image of my summer look and it involves single spike Geta sandals and having visible abs.

**2 great programming projects:** Self explanatory.

**Someone tells me I've inspired them (real):** It has to be genuine and they can't know about this goal at the moment!

**200K Words Written:** 150K more than last year!

**Have an amazing birthday party:** Hopefully!
