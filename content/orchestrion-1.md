    "My great-grandfather was a sculptor," the gentleman said. "He carved this relief over a period of three years. You can see here the intricate details of the world serpent, the braised horns down its neck and, ah, the warped fabrics around its maw. He spent so many hours staring at it through the shadow, trying to get every detail just so," he smiled, glancing at the frazzled tourist. "He was actually contacted by some research fellows, not sure from where, about how he was able to create such an accurate depiction of the creature; not sure what came of that, unfortunately. I wasn't able to ask him before his death. A shame he wasn't able to finish it in life."

  <p>"Yes, we petitioned and he was allowed to complete it after he passed."</p>

Imagine a society where passion, not survival, drives your existence. A society where you are at liberty to create art, pursue knowledge, gain social standing, and engage in whatever physical pursuits you desire. There is no soul-crushing labor, no mandatory toil.  People work for the betterment of themselves and society, in fields that they genuinely love. Retirement is unnecessary. Your path to the afterlife is already secured and the only position that matters is your station after death -- because in the Necrocracy, your service only begins in death.

The Cadaverine Necrocracy was founded in 684 AM (after-Mar), the time of the Fourth Founding, by the lady Alice I Lucette Quintrell, the first God-Empress. Alice descended from a minor noble family whose sole holding hugged the misty coastline of what would become the capital, Ahn. Their lands were never abundant; the Quintrells themselves prospered due to the sale of shellfish and sulfur, but the harsh conditions in these industries made for a sallow and hardened people. Alice hated being among them and her father, the baronet Aldarich, often felt the same, sealing himself away in their hold for years at a time studying queer magics while his people suffered. Alice often holed away with him, watching him in practice and study. This was intentional; even at her young age it was obvious she was a disciple of Mar, one of the Eldrean Guard.

By twelve, she was advising and instructing her father in all magical matters. At fifteen, dispelling storms that would take a council of mages was simple for her. She took to immersing all of her senses in the shadow, the realm of imagination or "pre-magic", with an intuition that unnerved those closest to her. While most mages could only perceive a flat, limited slice of the shadow realm through their Sight, Alice described depth and texture, dimension that shouldn't have been possible. It was said that Alice could see silver threads that wrapped around living beings like bindings; a view of a soul connected to a body, a connection that would persist after death.

Aldarich Quintrell would pass in the winter of 681 AM, when Alice was just sixteen. The diplomatic mission to the Fiels Islands was routine, a two day journey, a negotiation of fishing rights in the boundary between the two fiefs. A swift southern front brought a dramatic change in temperature, the weather becoming erratic. What began as a light snowfall, within hours, became vicious blizzard that claimed two vessels, including Aldarich’s flagship.

Word of Aldarich’s death reached Remich quickly. Seefürst Harwin Escher arrived at the Quintrell holding a week later, ostensibly to pay respects to the daughter of a loyal vassal. With him came representatives from three prominent merchant’s houses, already discussing among themselves how best to exploit the Ahnian wealth hidden along the coastline, and a delegation from Echternwch Zauberei, eager to assess if the daughter Quintrell shared her father’s talents.

The winter wind slashed against the tower’s walls, harsh and heavy on the old, quarried stone. The delegation had settled in the hall, the third floor of the tower, maps of Ahn’s holdings already unfurled across the long table. Alice sat at the table’s head, in her father’s seat, silent and small, as the men spoke about Ahnian lands and her potential wardship.

    “The girl will need proper instruction at Echternach,” insisted Magister Dorn. “Look at the quality of these enchantments — it’s warm as summertime in here! Such raw talent requires structure.”

    “And, of course," he adds, "the entitlement shall be paid with the release of these holdings,” the men silently nod their heads around the table, the concern already laid to rest.

    The girl had not spoken a word throughout their deliberations. Now, she raised her eyes to the window, as if expecting something. A commotion rose from below the tower, voices carrying on the winter wind.
