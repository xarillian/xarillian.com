<p>Hey, my name is Austin Wayne. I am a developer from the Canadian prairies.</p>

<p>I work at <a href="https://andgosystems.com/">Andgo Systems</a> in Saskatoon, SK, where I write absence management software and I think way too much about people calling in sick. Turns out, workforce management is pretty complex!</p>

<p>Technology is key to human flourishing. I like building things that people will care about, and pursue taste and stringent craftsmanship in everything I create. The smallest projects can provide immense value to the right person, even if that's just one person, or if that person is me. I've found that what resonates deeply with one person often resonates with many.</p>

<p>I built <a href="https://github.com/xarillian/GDLlama">GDLlama</a>, an extension for Godot 4 that brings local LLM inference to the engine through the brilliant llama.cpp. I wanted a tool that enabled developers to create emergent gameplay through AI-driven narratives. I wanted NPCs that felt embedded in the world, with personalities and motivations that could evolve over time. It started as an update fork for somebody else's work, but evolved into a complete re-write with a focus on usability, sustained development and improved developer experience.</p>

<p>I'm working on <a href="/tags/orchestrion">Orchestrion</a>, a fantasy worldbuilding project spanning multiple foundings of civilization. Every few generations, seven people are born as the <code>Eldrean Guard</code> with god-like magical ability. They have to figure out what to do with it. Some build empires on the back of undead servitors, some war against humanity; some just want to make music or surf all day. Power alone doesn't grant purpose. The long-term plan is either traditional publishing or serialized release on Substack.</p>

<p>I live in Saskatoon with my wife (my best friend) and our three cats. We've been married since the Spring of 2023. In Summer of 2025, I did my first triathlon. I'm training for my next few right now. I love the physical outlet; I need something that keeps me functional and gives me energy (so that I can sit at the computer for longer).</p>

<h2>About this Website</h2>

<p>This website is built with HTML (and CSS). A little python static site generator I wrote puts it all together, and then it's hosted on Github Pages. You can find the source code for it on my <a href="https://github.com/xarillian/xarillian.com/">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>The name is my once and future online handle, <code>xarillian</code>. I've used it since the early 2000s in various internet places. The memory of creating it stands out to me, though it isn't particularly exciting. It was in my elementary school computer lab, where I was creating an account for old school Runescape. I needed a username and I liked the letter X, as it is a cool letter. I added a weird suffix to it, and voila, <i>xarillian</i>. I've since stopped playing Runescape; the core gameplay never really resonated with me, but it continues to haunt me in mentions from friends and colleagues.</p>
