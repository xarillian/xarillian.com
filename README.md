# xarillian.com

xarillian.com is my personal website. I built it for fun, but I also built it to showcase my work, give a space for my
writing and to tell my story on the web. It is a dissolution of my privacy on the web, as well; a functional self-dox
of everything I've been up to for the past two decades. I just think it should be free.

Built with Flask and HTMX, as I'm trying to be minimal and extra at the same time.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/xarillian/xarillian.com.git
cd xarillian.com
```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the development server:

```
flask run
```
