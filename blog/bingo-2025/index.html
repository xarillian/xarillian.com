      <p>The past few years, I've written all of my goals down on a whiteboard in a large checklist. Sometimes I get through them all; a lot of the time I get through maybe half. In 2024, I was very ambitious. Too ambitious. I wanted to compose a song without knowing how to play the piano, dive into the hardest parts of embedded software without doing anything introductory, and hit a large savings goal. Some good came of that -- I relearned the piano, and if it weren't for a series of emergencies over the year, I would have hit the savings goal. But with embedded software, I hit a rut because what I wanted to do was so far out there that I couldn't see the starting point (that's bad!).</p>

<p>One of the only goals I hit was a modest 50K word target, which rekindled my love of writing and honestly that probably got me into the very good headspace I'm currently in. Because I fell so short last year, and because I saw someone else do it on the TikTok, I was inspired to create a "bingo" card for this year's personal development. That way, if I don't achieve everything, that's okay. I just have to hit a bingo -- a straight line across the board. That should be easy, right?</p>

<p>In the spirit of bingo, I didn't just want goals there either. I had to have some random events and states of being, just to give it some randomness in case I decided to go whole hog and try to get everything done. I could say more, but putting it out there seems better.</p>

<h2>The Goals</h2>

<p><strong>Get a random compliment from a stranger:</strong> I don't control this one, but I hope it happens!</p>

<p><strong>Find something amazing at a thrift shop:</strong> This one I tangentially control, but it mostly relates to wanting to thrift more.</p>

<p><strong>12 books read:</strong> 1 book/month is always a good goal</p>

<p><strong>3 camping trips:</strong> I did two last year. One more this year!</p>

<p><strong>Save $5K:</strong> Deliberately modest compared to last year to not incur violent wrath upon my savings like last year.</p>

<p><strong>Stretch for 30 days:</strong> I'm unbearably stiff. That's not "consecutive days" btw, that's any thirty days.</p>

<p><strong>Someone recommends a song I end up loving:</strong> Another one I don't control</p>

<p><strong>Try an adrenaline activity:</strong> My wife says "getting into a car crash doesn't count"</p>

<p><strong>Do a winter hike:</strong> I never have!</p>

<p><strong>States hiking trip:</strong> I did a trip to Montana last year. We're hoping to make this a tradition.</p>

<p><strong>Triathlon:</strong> A sprint triathlon.</p>

<p><strong>Go to a night sky preserve:</strong> There's one a province over. I love seeing the night sky.</p>

<p><strong>FREE:</strong> Learn anything to claim this space.</p>

<p><strong>Dig a really deep hole?</strong> One day I will have this manic energy and will dig this hole.</p>

<p><strong>Consistently achieve the second jhana:</strong> I can only hit the first reliably. I don't even know if I've hit the second before.</p>

<p><strong>Host a dinner party for friends:</strong> Seems fun!</p>

<p><strong>Swim Meet:</strong> Goes with the triathlon. I've been swimming competitively in a masters program and I should be ready this year.</p>

<p><strong>Run into an old friend unexpectedly and form a genuine connection:</strong> Love this one</p>

<p><strong>Play Megalovania on piano:</strong> Continuing my piano goal</p>

<p><strong>6 blood donations:</strong> Goodbye microplastics</p>

<p><strong>Abs + Geta sandals summer:</strong> I have a specific image of my summer look and it involves single spike Geta sandals and having visible abs.</p>

<p><strong>2 great programming projects:</strong> Self explanatory.</p>

<p><strong>Someone tells me I've inspired them (real):</strong> It has to be genuine and they can't know about this goal at the moment!</p>

<p><strong>200K Words Written:</strong> 150K more than last year!</p>

<p><strong>Have an amazing birthday party:</strong> Hopefully!</p>
